## Summary
<!--
A summary of the requirements that contextualises the costs

**Workshops for School Children: USD 1000**

I plan to conduct interactive workshops aimed at introducing school children to basic programming concepts through the creative activity of mandala coloring. These workshops will help bridge the gap between creativity and coding, fostering an interest in programming among younger audiences. The funding will cover materials, venue costs, and any necessary software tools to make the workshops a success.

**Package Development and Authoring: USD 1000**

As the main author and developer of the package, I will be responsible for all aspects of its creation, from coding and design to testing and deployment. The requested funding compensates for the time and expertise required to ensure the package meets the highest standards of usability and functionality. This includes ongoing maintenance and updates to ensure the package remains relevant and effective.

**Book Publishing: USD 500**

I plan to publish a book that complements the package, offering tutorials, creative ideas, and technical insights on how to use the mandala coloring tool effectively. The book will target both beginners in R and those interested in creative coding, helping to further promote the package and expand its reach. The funding will be used for editing, formatting, and publishing costs.
